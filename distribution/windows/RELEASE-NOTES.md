# Windows Runtime distribution

Version: the tag (`vX.Y.Z`) of the `HS7097/ActingCommand-Runtime` Release that
carries this zip; download the zip and `SHA256SUMS` from that Release. The
version exists only in the Release tag, not in the binaries or the manifest.
The same files taken from a pull-request or manually started Actions build are
an unreleased acceptance build with no version. The exact source commit, tree,
Cargo.lock hash, Rust toolchain, target, build profile, Actions run/attempt and
file identities are recorded in the accompanying `BUILD-MANIFEST.json`; the zip
and artifact names bind the complete source SHA.

The Windows `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` release-profile Runtime artifact includes the
resident `actingcommand-actingd.exe`, the `actingctl.exe` command client, an
editable configuration template, `INSTALL.md` and these notes. The manifest's
`runtime_payload_layout` is `distribution-v1`; all five payload files are required
and individually bound by size and SHA-256.

The existing exact-artifact downloader understands this layout and the historical
fixed two-executable Runtime layout whose manifest omits the field. It continues
to reject incomplete or unexpected payloads. The separate Tools artifact carries
`actinglab.exe`, `actingledger.exe`, `actingcommand-vision-provider-check.exe`,
`actingcommand-device-test.exe`, `ac_fastdeploy_ppocr.dll` and, under
`platform-tools/`, the official Android platform-tools 37.0.1 files `adb.exe`,
`AdbWinApi.dll`, `AdbWinUsbApi.dll`, `NOTICE.txt` and `source.properties`. Its
own manifest declares `tools_payload_layout: "platform-tools-v1"` and binds all
ten files; the downloader still accepts the historical five-file Tools layout
whose manifest omits the field and rejects any other layout.

The build takes `platform-tools_r37.0.1-win.zip` only from Google's official
`https://dl.google.com/android/repository/` URL and fails unless the archive has
the size and SHA-1 that Google publishes, the pinned SHA-256, and each shipped
file its pinned size and SHA-256, and unless `adb.exe version` reports
`37.0.1-15733141`. Of the archive's binaries only `adb.exe` and its two DLLs are
shipped; Google's `NOTICE.txt` and `source.properties` stay unchanged beside them.
They are redistributed by the owner's decision under the Android SDK License and
the open-source licenses in `NOTICE.txt`. Installed, they are in
`<install root>\tools\platform-tools\`, and
`<install root>\tools\platform-tools\adb.exe` is the adb that an instance with an
empty `adb_path` uses.

Configuration uses `actingcommand.actingd.config.v1` and the existing
`actingcommand-actingd --config <path>` entry. The supplied template has empty
private state-root and salt values and no device instances; once `state_root`
and `secret_fingerprint_salt` are filled, the template's `"instances": []` starts
a control-plane-only daemon, and instances are added by editing the
configuration and restarting. Follow `INSTALL.md`
and the exact source schema to provide a private configuration and any required
provider dependencies before use.

This distribution change adds packaging and documentation to the existing
Actions build. It does not change daemon/client operation, install dependencies
or services, or perform startup, state migration or device actions. Actions
results establish only their recorded build and check outcomes; installation,
provider availability, real-device behavior and functional acceptance require
their own evidence. Features from other unaccepted candidates are not represented
by these notes. Release version, tag, publication channel and final sign-off
remain separate decisions.
