# PLANS.md

## Repository goal

`ActingCommand-Runtime` is the Rust mainline runtime repository for ActingCommand.

The runtime owns device/control primitives, capture primitives, recognition primitives, and later runtime orchestration components behind explicit interfaces.

## Current implementation line

- Rust workspace is the mainline implementation.
- Python runtime is legacy/mock only and lives outside this repository.
- Go runtime/core is historical reference and benchmark material only and lives outside this repository.

## Current completed milestones

- P1.6 MaaTouch input backend stability close-out.
- P2 ADB `exec-out screencap -p` capture backend.
- P2.1 capture artifact store.
- P2.1.1 capture artifact path security close-out.
- P4a threshold-free recognition primitive engine.

## Repo-local planning policy

Runtime planning and checkpoint records live in this repository.

For Runtime tasks, update `PLANS.md` and `CHECKPOINT.md` here and commit them with the Runtime source changes. Do not mirror Runtime task planning files into the umbrella repository by default.

Routine Runtime updates must stay in `HS7097/ActingCommand-Runtime`. Do not merge, copy, or synchronize Runtime changes into the umbrella/main `HS7097/ActingCommand` repository unless the user explicitly confirms that a specific Runtime state is ready for that merge.

## Active boundaries

- No ADB input fallback.
- MaaTouch failure is fatal.
- Capture failure is fatal.
- Recognition primitive errors are fatal.
- No OpenCV in P4a recognition primitives.
- No OCR until a separate scoped milestone.
- No SQLite until a separate scoped milestone.
- No UI in this repository.
- No game logic until a specific runtime/game milestone.
- No upstream source or asset copying without license, attribution, and boundary review.

## Next steps

1. Define P4b recognition data loading and threshold policy outside the P4a primitive engine.
2. Define runtime-owned capture metadata and image reference lifecycle.
3. Define SQLite schema in a separate scoped milestone.
4. Define how Runtime exposes capture and recognition results to UI/API layers.
5. Keep `CHECKPOINT.md` updated with every completed Runtime task.
